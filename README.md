# Clicked Mini Sprint Incident Response
The presentation attached in this repository is the work I did on this scenario of unusual activity happening at Maven Clinic. The experience required me going through the NIST incident response life cycle. 
# Scenario: Maven Clinic Unusual Activity
You've been hired to come in as a security analyst on a team working for Maven Clinic. Maven Clinic, a file transfer platform, recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network. As a security analyst for Maven Clinic, your task is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review. You will be working closely with Gemma Chan, CTO to complete this project.
